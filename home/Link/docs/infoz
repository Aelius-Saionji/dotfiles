[Notes]
qiv doesn't set the background wallpaper in a way that works with transparency, which is why we keep feh around
st has transparency compiled in from the source (via a patch)
compton is newer than xcompmgr, use compton
terminal font: inconsolata
dvtm MOD-e loads the terminal buffer in vim
like ditto on windows, the clipboard history (program: clipmenu) is ctrl`
dwm is now responsible for opening URLs, press MOD-u to open any selected text with ~/.bin/browser.sh
set window class with the following: xprop -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS newclasshere
baobab is an awesome disk usage visualizer
devilspie can be used to wait for windows to appear, and do things to them
fbgrab - screenshot of the non X terminal
fbv - view images in the non X terminal


First, extract the three tarballs from the .deb file :
# ar vx package.deb
Then extract the contents of data.tar.gz using tar:
# tar xzvf data.tar.gz

[Flow]
.zshrc adds ~/.bin to $PATH
	.xinitrc runs my sh script, [~/.bin/]dwm-personalized 
		dwm-personalized runs compton for transparency, all exclusions are classes which I have manually patched into dwm/dmenu
dwm launches st with dvtm


[Todo]
better tab location
better dvtm modkey
run or raise st?
hacky solution to qiv / other img viewers losing focus: move the cursor to the center of the screen with xdotool or other
keep this in mind http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwm-6.1-dwmfifo.diff
	for example, if we hide the statusbar, irssi could fifo it back on with a hilight
