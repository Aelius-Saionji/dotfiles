better Tabkey location
Talim stick- scrollwheel instead of arrow keys?
hacky solution to img viewers losing focus: move the cursor to the center of the screen with xdotool or other
	or, remove X focus follows cursor functionality from dwm
find a way to remind me to do a monthly check of the git packages from aur

can wmctrl be used to replace dwm runorraise on multiple monitors?
calendar + notifications?
irc notifications?
sxiv trash-cli
mpv trash-cli
	trash wrapper on windows?
custom system beep

dwm status tell me when network is down!

switch away from netctl and use wpa directly? netctl is in arch's base though...
	still, take advantage of what we can. There's the wpa_cli -a script.sh for notify-send, but it will have to be tied to a service
		because if netctl is turned off, wpa_supplicant is killed, and wpa_cli -a will die.
	related- take advantage of netctl hooks to manipulate network-online.target (perhaps to bring the wpa_cli service up if we go that route, update dwmstatus, idk).
	related- kick dhcpcd in the butt. At least with netctl-auto, if I toggle the physical wifi switch, everything reconnects fine but the ip is reset and dhcpcd doesn't renew it automatically
	implement signal strength in dwm status, maybe ip address?

----- Maybe fixed?-----

	the above appears to do the trick, but also I cought it hanging eating 100% of the cpu not half an hour after installing...
email
