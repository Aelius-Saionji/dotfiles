find a way to remind me to do a monthly check of the git packages from aur
	possibly just add that crap to rss
instead of a screensaver, toggle all tags out of view after a certain timeout (xssstate?)
add a partition for bootable recovery
monitor timeout
do something with the touchpad (make it middle click?)
clipboard issues as always
volume bar I wrote appears to be very inaccurate

calendar / email + notifications?
note compton exclude on archwiki
always running st term (while true; do st)
rdp key
can wmctrl be used to replace dwm runorraise on multiple monitors?

fix slock delay
	xss-lock -l slock
	the above appears to do the trick, but also I cought it hanging eating 100% of the cpu not half an hour after installing...
