[Notes]
	-Transparency-
		qiv doesn't set the background wallpaper in a way that works with transparency, which is why we keep feh around
		st has transparency compiled in from the source (via a patch)
		compton is newer than xcompmgr, use compton
	-Terminal-
		terminal font: inconsolata
		dvtm MOD-e loads the terminal buffer in vim
		dvtm: on devices with Appkey, map Appskey to F13 (VT: systemd service, X11: xmodmap), compile dvtm with mod: Key_F(13)
	-WM Usage-
		MOD is Windows key or Right Alt
		MOD-p is program launcher
		clipboard history (program: clipmenu): ctrl` (like Ditto on Windows)
		Open URLs: MOD-u opens selected text with ~/.bin/browser.sh

[Flow]
.zshrc adds ~/.bin to $PATH
	.xinitrc runs my sh script, [~/.bin/]dwm-personalized 
		dwm-personalized runs compton for transparency, all exclusions are classes which I have manually patched into slock/dwm/dmenu
dwm launches st with dvtm

[Necessities]
	abs.git
	zsh (sets path, is great)
	grml-zsh-config (extreme convenience)
	ttf-dejavu (browsers)
	ttf-inconsolata (terminal)
	xsel (for url launching, ranger, clipmenu)
	rfkill (Talim's unfuck wifi needs this)
	feh (sets the wallpaper)
	aur/abduco (for irc)
	aur/compton-git
	aur/clipmenu-git
	aur/mmkeyosd (also handles keybindings)
		could revert to dwm control, append dwmstatus-trigger-update.sh for real time update

[Todo]
better tab location
figure out if I need the font ttf-hanazono
Talim touchpad
Talim stick- scrollwheel instead of arrow keys?
hacky solution to qiv / other img viewers losing focus: move the cursor to the center of the screen with xdotool or other
	or, remove X focus follows cursor functionality from dwm
keep this in mind http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwm-6.1-dwmfifo.diff
	for example, if we hide the statusbar, irssi could fifo it back on with a hilight
		(tried patching this in, it compiled but crashed)

[Misc]
	-Extract .deb-
		Extract contents of .deb
		# ar vx package.deb
		Everything is in data.tar.gz
	-Programs I'll never remember-
		autofs - mount drives when they're plugged in, mount samba when you navigate to it
		baobab - awesome disk usage visualizer
		devilspie - wait for windows to appear, do things to them
		fbgrab - VT screenshot
		fbv - VT image viewer
	-Bad cat-
		read -r var < file
