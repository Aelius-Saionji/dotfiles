[Notes]
	-Transparency-
		qiv doesn't set the background wallpaper in a way that works with transparency, which is why we keep feh around
			* replaced qiv with sxiv, which can't set the background
		st has transparency compiled in from the source (via a patch)
			* had transparency, the patch breaks ranger's image previews, so I've removed it for now
		compton is newer than xcompmgr, use compton
	-Terminal-
		terminal font: inconsolata
		dvtm MOD-e loads the terminal buffer in vim
		dvtm: on devices with Appkey, map Appskey to F13 (VT: systemd service, X11: xmodmap), compile dvtm with mod: Key_F(13)
	-WM Usage-
		MOD is Windows key or Right Alt
		MOD-p is program launcher
		clipboard history (program: clipmenu): ctrl` (like Ditto on Windows)
		Open URLs: MOD-u opens selected text with ~/.bin/browser.sh

[Flow]
	.zshrc adds ~/.bin to $PATH
		.xinitrc runs my sh script, [~/.bin/]dwm-personalized 
			dwm-personalized runs compton for transparency, all exclusions are classes which I have manually patched into slock/dwm/dmenu
			dwm-personalized can bind appskey to F13, enable per device as needed. systemd service is for VT.
	dwm launches st with dvtm

[Necessities]
	abs.git
	aur/abduco (for irc)
	aur/clipmenu
	aur/compton
	aur/twmn-git (popup notification daemon)
	feh (sets the wallpaper)
	grml-zsh-config (extreme convenience)
	lxappearance (set gtk, mouse themes)
	rfkill (Talim's unfuck wifi may need this)
	#statnot (xsetroot notification daemon) (doesn't work with fullscreen programs)
	ttf-dejavu (browsers)
	ttf-hanazono (everything else and maybe jpn letters?)
	ttf-inconsolata (terminal)
	w3m (image preview in ranger)
	xf86-input-synaptics (can't configure without)
	xfce4-power-manager-settings & xfce4-power-manager (systemd is really shitty at handling power events. Until systemd *works*, I'll defer to this, as I already have xfce installed as a tablet interface)
	xorg-xbacklight
	xorg-xmodmap
	xorg-xrandr (screen rotation, multi monitor display setting)
	xorg-xsetroot
	xsel (for url launching, ranger, clipmenu)
	zsh (sets path, is great)

[Talim]
	Circular scrolling works better than vertical (should probably revisit vertical) and the two are incompatible
		At least, natural scrolling breaks while Circular is on. Slide in from the right to circular scroll.
	Mute key is hardwired to mute the speaker, no need to bind it.
	/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf | Option	"TearFree"	"true"
		fixes screen tearing but could introduce issues with games. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_graphics#Tear-free_video
	libva-intel-driver-g45-h264 video hw decoding

[Todo]
	better Tabkey location
	Talim stick- scrollwheel instead of arrow keys?
	hacky solution to qiv / other img viewers losing focus: move the cursor to the center of the screen with xdotool or other
		or, remove X focus follows cursor functionality from dwm
	keep this in mind http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwm-6.1-dwmfifo.diff
		for example, if we hide the statusbar, irssi could fifo it back on with a hilight
			(tried patching this in, it compiled but crashed)

[Misc]
	-Extract .deb-
		Extract contents of .deb
		# ar vx package.deb
		Everything is in data.tar.gz
	-Programs I'll never remember-
		autofs - mount drives when they're plugged in, mount samba when you navigate to it
		baobab - awesome disk usage visualizer
		devilspie - wait for windows to appear, do things to them
		fbgrab - VT screenshot
		fbv - VT image viewer
		llpp - mupdf with some conveniences
		mmkeyosd - key bindings with integrated OSD
		sxhkd - better than xbindkeys
	-Files I'll never remember-
		~/.gtkrc-2.0 for setting the font size in inkscape. Breaks xombrero, firefox fonts.
		~/.config/user-dirs.dirs for telling firefox to not make the Desktop folder
	-Bad cat-
		read -r var < file
	-Identify Hardlinks-
		ls -i = inode #, find -inum <#>
		find -printf "%n %p\n" %n is number of hardlinks
		find -samefile <file>
