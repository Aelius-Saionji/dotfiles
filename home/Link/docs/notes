[Notes]
	-Transparency-
		qiv doesn't set the background wallpaper in a way that works with transparency, which is why we keep feh around
		st has transparency compiled in from the source (via a patch)
		compton is newer than xcompmgr, use compton
	-Terminal-
		terminal font: inconsolata
		dvtm MOD-e loads the terminal buffer in vim
		dvtm: on devices with Appkey, map Appskey to F13 (VT: systemd service, X11: xmodmap), compile dvtm with mod: Key_F(13)
	-WM Usage-
		MOD is Windows key or Right Alt
		MOD-p is program launcher
		clipboard history (program: clipmenu): ctrl` (like Ditto on Windows)
		Open URLs: MOD-u opens selected text with ~/.bin/browser.sh

[Flow]
.zshrc adds ~/.bin to $PATH
	.xinitrc runs my sh script, [~/.bin/]dwm-personalized 
		dwm-personalized runs compton for transparency, all exclusions are classes which I have manually patched into slock/dwm/dmenu
dwm launches st with dvtm

[Necessities]
	abs.git
	zsh (sets path, is great)
	grml-zsh-config (extreme convenience)
	ttf-dejavu (browsers)
	ttf-inconsolata (terminal)
	ttf-hanazono (everything else and maybe jpn letters?)
	xsel (for url launching, ranger, clipmenu)
	rfkill (Talim's unfuck wifi needs this)
	feh (sets the wallpaper)
	xf86-input-synaptics (can't configure without)
	aur/abduco (for irc)
	aur/compton
	aur/clipmenu-git
	aur/mmkeyosd-git (also handles keybindings)
		could revert to dwm control, append dwmstatus-trigger-update.sh for real time update

[Talim]
	Circular scrolling works better than vertical (should probably revisit vertical) and the two are incompatible
		At least, natural scrolling breaks while Circular is on. Slide in from the right to circular scroll.
	Mute key is hardwired to mute the speaker, no need to bind it.
	/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf | Option	"TearFree"	"true"
		fixes screen tearing but could introduce issues with games. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_graphics#Tear-free_video

[Todo]
better tab location
Talim stick- scrollwheel instead of arrow keys?
hacky solution to qiv / other img viewers losing focus: move the cursor to the center of the screen with xdotool or other
	or, remove X focus follows cursor functionality from dwm
keep this in mind http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwm-6.1-dwmfifo.diff
	for example, if we hide the statusbar, irssi could fifo it back on with a hilight
		(tried patching this in, it compiled but crashed)

[Misc]
	-Extract .deb-
		Extract contents of .deb
		# ar vx package.deb
		Everything is in data.tar.gz
	-Programs I'll never remember-
		autofs - mount drives when they're plugged in, mount samba when you navigate to it
		baobab - awesome disk usage visualizer
		devilspie - wait for windows to appear, do things to them
		fbgrab - VT screenshot
		fbv - VT image viewer
	-Files I'll never remember-
		~/.gtkrc-2.0 for setting the font size in inkscape. Breaks xombrero, firefox fonts.
		~/.config/user-dirs.dirs for telling firefox to not make the Desktop folder
	-Bad cat-
		read -r var < file
