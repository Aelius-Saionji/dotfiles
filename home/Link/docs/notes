[Notes]
	-Transparency-
		qiv doesn't set the background wallpaper in a way that works with transparency, which is why we keep feh around
			* replaced qiv with sxiv, which also can't set the background
		st has transparency compiled in from the source (via a patch)
			* the patch breaks ranger's image previews
		compton is newer than xcompmgr, use compton
	-Terminal-
		terminal font: inconsolata
		dvtm MOD-e loads the terminal buffer in vim
			* dvtm MOD is Ctrl-g
		st MOD-u opens a dmenu based url launcher
			* st MOD is Left Alt
	-WM Usage-
		dwm MOD is Windows key or Right Alt
		MOD-p is program launcher
		clipboard history (program: clipmenu): ctrl` (like Ditto on Windows)
		Open URLs: MOD-u opens selected text with ~/.bin/browser.sh

[Flow]
	.zshrc adds ~/.bin to $PATH
		.xinitrc runs my sh script, [~/.bin/]dwm-personalized 
			dwm-personalized runs compton for transparency
	dwm launches st with dvtm
	dwm handles keyboard shortcuts, no need for xbindkeys

[Necessities]
	abs.git
	aur/abduco (for irc)
	aur/clipmenu
	aur/statnot (xsetroot notification daemon) (doesn't work with fullscreen programs)
	aur/twmn-git -or- dunst (notification daemon)
	aur/xss-lock-git (for running slock when appropriate. non-git version eats 100% of CPU)
	compton
	feh (sets the wallpaper)
	grml-zsh-config (extreme convenience)
	gtk-xfce-engine -and/or- aur/gtk-theme-windows10 (themes)
	lxappearance (set gtk, mouse themes)
	trash-cli (interface to the standard trash)
	ttf-dejavu (browsers)
	ttf-hanazono (everything else and maybe jpn letters?)
	ttf-inconsolata (terminal)
	xf86-input-synaptics (can't configure without)
	xorg-xbacklight
	xorg-xmodmap
	xorg-xrandr (screen rotation, multi monitor display setting)
	xorg-xsetroot
	xsel (for url launching, ranger, clipmenu)
	zsh (sets path, is great)

[Talim]
	Mute key is hardwired to mute the speaker, no need to bind it.
	libva-intel-driver-g45-h264 - video hw decoding

[Misc]
	-Extract .deb-
		Extract contents of .deb
		# ar vx package.deb
		Everything is in data.tar.gz
	-Programs I'll never remember-
		baobab - awesome disk usage visualizer
		fbgrab - VT screenshot
		fbv - VT image viewer
		llpp - mupdf with some conveniences
		mmkeyosd - key bindings with integrated OSD
		okular - touch friendly viewer
		remmina - A good frontend to freerdp
		rfkill - Talim's unfuck wifi may need this
		sxhkd - better than xbindkeys
		unclutter-xfixes-git - hide mouse cursor after timeout
		w3m - image preview in ranger
	-Files I'll never remember-
		~/.gtkrc-2.0 for setting the font size in inkscape. Breaks xombrero, firefox fonts.
		~/.config/user-dirs.dirs for telling firefox to not make the Desktop folder
	-Bad cat-
		read -r var < file
	-Identify Hardlinks-
		ls -i = inode #, find -inum <#>
		find -printf "%n %p\n" %n is number of hardlinks
		find -samefile <file>
	-Samba share mounting-
		Use fstab to auto mount predefined shares upon accessing, and auto unmount after idle timeout
			https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab#Automount_with_systemd
			https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Samba#Add_Share_to_.2Fetc.2Ffstab
		//server/share /mntpoint cifs credentials=file,uid=localLinuxUser,gid=users,noauto,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.idle-timeout=1min,x-systemd.requires=network-online.target 0 0
			Unless uid and gid are set, root will own the mount and all files
			noauto prevents mounting at boot and mounting with mount -a
			x-systemd.automount apparently mounts the entry when someone tries to access the mount point
			x-systemd.idle-timeout=1min unmounts the entry when the mount point has not been touched in 1 minute
	-Synclient can connect to synaptics driver-
		Install xf86-input-evdev, uninstall xf86-input-libinput (which overrides synptics for some reason).
		xorg-server depends on at least one of those, you can't uninstall one without having the other installed.
